    "## General Notes\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook has been prepared by the student author (me, Franklin Bueno) in order to provide a simple guide for the Instructor-Grader (IG). As instructed, this file and the rest of the assignment are stored in a new repository called 'unit13-challenge.' This Jupyter Notebook holds the Python script with the lambda function in the cell (below). Furthermore, from the Amazon Lex Console, the bot, intent, and slot were exported using 'Amazon Lex' as the target platform, and the ZIP files were uploaded to the GitHub repository. Also provided is a short video showing a demonstration of the RoboAdvisor Bot in action from the test window.\n",

    "\n",
    "As stated before, 99.9999% of this work comes from other sources. Primarily, the student author leveraged the spoken and written examples of Instructor GS, Instructor AN, and Instructor KS (for example, the student author was instructed not to use the confirmation function for the chatbot function). In addition, the student author used the instruction of the Tutor, Ms. LT. The student author leveraged information on the relevant programs from amazon.com. Furthermore, the student author leveraged the code in a message from classmate Ms. SF during the pre-class office hours administered by Instructor GS and held by Instructor AN. The source for the YouTube formatting is from https://damien.pobel.fr/post/youtube-video-github/. Other sources are provided as leveraged throughout this document.\n",
